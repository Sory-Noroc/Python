The Imdb Scraper is a terminal based program that gets input a movie and searches on Imdb the movie description, raiting, etc.

The Music Player is a GUI based app with all the functionality of a music player. It can play, plause, stop, change, add, restart, etc music, the best thing being
an auto-play feature that will play your playlist as long as you don't stop it. I enjoy using it all the time.

The Snake game is pretty much what it sounds. A nice GUI from which you start the game and choose the settings, then enjoy the old-school game.
