The Imdb Scraper(Linux) is a terminal based program that gets input a movie and searches on Imdb the movie description, raiting, etc.

The Music Player, written on Windows, is a GUI based app with all the functionality of a music player. It can play, plause, stop, change, add, restart, etc music, the best thing being
an auto-play feature that will play your playlist as long as you don't stop it. I enjoy using it all the time.

The Snake game(Windows) is pretty much what it sounds. A nice GUI from which you start the game and choose the settings, then enjoy the old-school game.

The Speech to doc file(Linux) is a program that can record sound from devices (microphone and even speaker/earphones, etc.) recognize what was said and write the words to a document. If the devices are good enough, the translation is pretty accurate!

If you want to use any of my programs, contact me as there might be version issues and I can help. Have a nice day.
